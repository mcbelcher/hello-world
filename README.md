# hello-world
first repository

I am learning the python programming language.
This is the first computer language that I am tryng to learn.
I am using a course from coursera and learn python the hard way; LPTHW directed me to this site to learn more about code.
So far, as of now I am doing the github hello-world activity to learn more about github before I start exploring the code.

It is 22 November 2021; I cannot believe I already had a GitHub account from 2016!
